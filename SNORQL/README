SNORQL is an AJAXy front-end for exploring RDF SPARQL endpoints

It was originally created by Richard Cyganaik ( http://richard.cyganiak.de/ )
for the D2R server project ( http://www4.wiwiss.fu-berlin.de/bizer/d2r-server/ ).

SNORQL can be used with just about any SPARQL endpoint that supports JSON. To
use SNORQL simply put the ./snorql directory somwhere sensible in the Apache
web directory and modify ./snorql/snorql.js to conform with your setup.  You
can also modify the pre-defined namespaces in ./snorql/namespaces.js
