Future Enhancments for Web Repository
=====================================

HTML Frontend
-------------

* For search to be restricted to things for which we have
  provenance. Currently text matches in Virtuoso's graphs
  are returned.
* To only return the latest version of objects (i.e. test
  prv:preceededBy).

Endpoints
---------

* Use media tags in stream requests? In general?
* Test, demo streaming (with C client libraries). (Chapter 5 ???)
